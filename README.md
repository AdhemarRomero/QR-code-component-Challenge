## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project I reinforced that knowledge acquired in a self-taught way. However, I learned to realize, what types of measures to use depending on the context, in the css.

### Continued development

Just as I've learned things, I know I don't have clean code yet. So I will keep practicing to improve.

Any comments on this or other projects would be very helpful.

### Useful resources

- [Screen height](https://desarrolloweb.com/faq/css-height-100) - This helped me, since I didn't remember how to set the full height of the screen.
